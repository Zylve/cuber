# Cuber
Cuber is an automatic rubiks cube robot that can read the state of a 3x3 cube and solve it using servo motors.

The inspiration for Cuber came from watching videos of world record solvers. I always thought they were really cool. Why not make it myself? It's been a couple years but now I'm actually doing it!
