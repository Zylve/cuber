# Cuber
Cuber is an automatic rubiks cube robot that can read the state of a 3x3 cube and solve it using servo motors.

Cuber was funded by and built for Hack Club's [Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com) program. You can read my journal [here](./JOURNAL.md). Find documentation on how to build your own [here](./docs/README.md).
