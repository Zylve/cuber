# May 15th: Started work!
Cooked up my idea and started researching the parts lying around in my kit and the school shop.

Okay so basically I set up the platformio dev environment and got my esp32 driving an MG996R stepper motor.

I've been wanting to create something like this for a while and I bought these components several months ago but never got around to seriously starting work on it. (And now it looks like Purdue beat me to it lol.)

Anyway I think the best way to properly begin this is to setup some goals for ***Cuber:***
- Create an automatic motorized Rubik's Cube solver.
- Have it automatically detect the initial state of the cube using colour sensors.
- Implement an algorithm like *Kociemba's* to solve the cube.
- Have an automatic scrambler to allow continuous action.
- 3D print a custom case to house components, that allows for easy access to the cube.

Wow that is a lot of goals haha.

To keep the kinematics of the cube simple, I will use a similar approach to the students at Purdue and MIT: 6 motors, one for each face of the  (no full cube rotations). To allow for access to the cube, I will allow the housing for each motor to swing out like a flower, letting me swap the cube in and out.

I got 6 TCS3200 colour sensors from my school, and the idea is that one could cover each face of the cube on the corner, and rotate the face at 30Â° intervals to detect all 12 stickers.

I then imported the MG996R into Fusion 360 and designed a pinion for the Rubiks cube. It will drive the cube sides by slotting into the middle piece. This is when I realized that the motor spline is to small for my 3D printer to print. Instead, I will use the injection molded pinion that came with the motors, and probably superglue the pinion to it or smt idk.
